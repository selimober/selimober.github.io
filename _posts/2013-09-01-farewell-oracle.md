title: Farewell Oracle, kind of...

I've finally gathered the courage to execute the idea which was eating me for a long time.

I was with Oracle for the last two years. Working as a consultant with big enterprises. It's been a tremendous experience for me. Observing a giant operating from this close was definitely a rare chance.

I got to know many great people, and friendship was / is always strong.

But (yes, there is always a big, hairy "but" lurking around the corner) I was getting less chance every day to practice what was fueling me. I loved software development, everyday challenges of building a product, designing valuable applications. And there was still lots of new things I wanted to explore, experiment...

So with mutual agreement, I've switched to a contractor position. I will still continue to work with Oracle on project basis, but in the meantime I'll get some free time for trying a couple of ideas I got in mind. I also secretly hope to meet people along the way who share my passion.

So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish...
