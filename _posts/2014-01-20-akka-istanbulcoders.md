Last week, I gave a talk about Multithreaded programming in general and some details about Akka. It was a refreshing experience since I remembered, once again, how troublesome and intricate *concurrency* could be.

Folks at [IstanbulCoders](http://istanbulcoders.org) were, as always, great. They kept the energy high all the time with though questions and providing their inputs on the subject. This was the **47th meetup** and with every event, this organisation continues to grow, to reach people who really care about their profession and who are passionate about software. I'm proud to be part of this community and I do know someday, it will help shaping the software industry in Turkey.

See you next Thursday!
