Well, I don't know how to express my feelings about this book. First of all, if English is not your native tongue, you might need to wait a bit to get used to flow of the narrative. I promise it will be worth it.

While long time in my list by a friend's recommendation, I downloaded the book to kindle in a rush, before a flight, thus I didn't have any background information. My first shock came, later on, when I discovered that it was written in 1969. For the plot, I don't mind copying directly from [Malbadeen's great review at GoodReads:](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5243700)

That's actually how it goes on and on and on. But that's absolutely not to say it's boring. Far from it. It's has been speculated whether the content is imagination or author's childhood memories. Whatever it may be, it's very rich, funny, perverted, sad and provoking.
