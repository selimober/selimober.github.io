To be honest, I don't like / understand how this book can be a bestseller? No, the book is awesome and deserves to be one. But it's heavy, full of hard to grasp stuff and thought provoking. Not your usual bestseller. And plus, I've studied most of the things explained here in college. Still I read most passages two times.

I guess I'm victim of a bit of intellectual snobbery :)
